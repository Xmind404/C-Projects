# C-Projects
A collection of 25 simple but effective C programs - sourced from GeeksforGeeks.
Includes classics like Rock Paper Scissors, Snake, and 2048, as well as practical mini-systems like a Library Management System and a Voting System.
Built with pure C, without any external libraries.
Just basic logic, loops, and a terminal interface.
